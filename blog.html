              <p><h3>1.VAR</h3> <span class="font-bold">'var'</span> declarations are function-scoped. This means that variables declared with var are only visible within the function in which they are declared.</p>
              <p><h3>2.LET</h3> <span class="font-bold">'let'</span> declarations are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing block (usually denoted by {}), whether it's a function, loop, or conditional statement.</p>
              <p><h3>3.CONST</h3> <span class="font-bold">'const'</span> declarations are also block-scoped like let.
                Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. However, it's important to note that objects and arrays declared with const can have their properties or elements modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned.</p>

            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <p><span class="font-bold">'null'</span> is often used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property has no value or that it represents the absence of data.</p>
              <p><span class="font-bold">'undefined</span>is typically the initial value of variables in JavaScript. When you declare a variable without assigning a value, it's automatically set to undefined.</p>

It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST is not a specific technology or protocol but rather a set of constraints and principles that are commonly used in web services and web development.</p>
